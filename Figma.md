## Some points about Grid :-

* First select the canvas for putting grid, you can use *Ctrl+A* to select the canvas
* Grid is used to keep the elements in the canvas structured.
* By default a grid with 10 pixels is selected.
* Shortcut for Grid: *Shift+G*

# Visual Hierarchy

## Importance of Visual Hierarchy

* Each element in the canvas should have different weightages/importance.
* Different weightages of the elements prevents the content being to overwhelming for the user.*
* Helps in guiding the user indirectly.
* Each webpage should have a focal point where the main attention of the user goes to.
*

## Example of a Web Page having no Visual Hierarchy :-

# Optical Illusions

1. Sometimes although elements are of the same size, one looks bigger than the other.
2. This is due to the heaviness of the object.
3. Heavier the object, greater seems to be its size to the human eye.

## Example of an Optical Illusion :- 
![[Pasted image 20231211122757.png]]

Although both the icons are of the same size, the left one looks smaller than the right.
There is no specific height or scale to which the size of the smaller seeming element has to be increased. It is done through estimation to a point which would be perceived pleasant to the user.

## Sinking Effect

* Heavier objects tend to have a sinking effect which should be removed.
* Lighter objects seem to have a floating effect
*
![[Pasted image 20231211123626.png]]
Sometimes if you align the text exactly at the center it gives a sinking effect which should be removed by placing the text a little above the center alignment of the page.

![[Pasted image 20231211123741.png]]

* After placing it above it looks as if it is floating which is a better design.
* Sometime it also depends on the typography..
* Don't need to make any changes if no optical illusion is present.

# Proximity

It is basically grouping of related elements together

Many of the designers have a fear of having empty spaces, but a good design should have proximity.

# Typography

Typography is **the art of arranging letters and text in a way that makes the copy legible, clear, and visually appealing to the reader**. It involves font style, appearance, and structure, which aims to elicit certain emotions and convey specific messages. In short, typography is what brings the text to life.

Type is short for typeface.

Remember Typeface and fonts are different

## Typeface comes with a personality

A typeface is **the underlying visual design that can exist in many different typesetting technologies**, and a font is one of these implementations. In other words, a typeface is what you see and a font is what you use.

Different types of typefaces are used for different type of webpage personas.

In design, the terms "typefaces," "fonts," "styles," and "font family" are closely related but have distinct meanings. Here's a breakdown of the differences:

1. **Typeface:**
    
    - A typeface refers to the overall design of characters, including letters, numbers, and symbols. It represents a consistent visual appearance or style.
    - Examples of typefaces include Times New Roman, Arial, and Helvetica.
    - Think of a typeface as a collection of characters with a unified design aesthetic.
2. **Font:**
    
    - A font is a specific instance or variant of a typeface. It represents a particular style, size, and weight within a typeface family.
    - For example, Arial Regular, Arial Bold, and Arial Italic are different fonts within the Arial typeface.
    - Fonts within a typeface family may share common design elements but have variations in thickness, slant, or other attributes.
3. **Style:**
    
    - In the context of typefaces and fonts, a style refers to a specific variation within a font family. It can include attributes like bold, italic, regular, light, etc.
    - Styles allow for different expressions of the same typeface. For instance, Times New Roman Regular and Times New Roman Italic represent different styles within the Times New Roman font family.
4. **Font Family:**
    
    - A font family is a group of related fonts that share a common design theme or style. It includes different styles, weights, and variations within the same typeface.
    - Font families provide a range of options for designers to maintain consistency while using different styles for various purposes.
    - Examples of font families include Arial (Arial Regular, Arial Bold, Arial Italic, etc.) or Garamond (Garamond Regular, Garamond Bold, Garamond Italic, etc.).

In summary, a typeface is the overall design, a font is a specific style or instance within that design, a style represents a particular variation (e.g., bold or italic) within a font, and a font family is a collection of related fonts with variations in style, weight, and other attributes. Understanding these distinctions is essential for effective typography in design.

### Typeface Categories :-

1. Serif
2. Sans Serif*
3. Display/Decorative
4. Script

*![[Pasted image 20231211130113.png]]
*![[Pasted image 20231211125858.png | 400]]

* The tails on the font are called serif 
* In french, sans means without hence the name sans serif.

### Serif

Serif has 3 distinctive styles :- 
![[Pasted image 20231213071831.png | 600]]

1. **Oldstyle**-  Most commonly used in print. Classic traditional style that goes way back.
Oldstyle Sarif fonts are being used in web design recenlty, smaller fonts are harder to see on the screen due to low resolution and screen flickering due to which they were not used earlier.

This is the reason why sans serif font are dominant in web design but recently serif fonts are  being used in blogpages.

Serif Oldstyle is mainly used in classical style webpages like for Resturants , Lawfirms, Musical etc.



1. **Modern**- Similar to Oldstyle, but there are some distinctive changes:-
* * Tail is flat in Modern.
![[Pasted image 20231211131528.png | 400]]

* There dramatic contrast between the thick and thinness between the legs.*
![[Pasted image 20231211131855.png | 400]]
* Used mainly in Luxury design category. *modern serious and refined personality* *
* Used in headlines i.e short readable formats
* Not good for long readable formats
![[Pasted image 20231211132059.png | 350]]

3. **Slab**- This style has a mechanical presence and blocky look to it . It doesn't have contrast in thickness and thinness like in Modern. It's not good for paragraphs and only suitable for headings.

 ![[Pasted image 20231213073125.png | 150]]


### Sans Serif
It is the main type we'll end up using in designs. It is versatile and the least risky choice when selecting different types of typefaces.

It can perfectly work with both headings and paragraphs. They can cover a huge range of personalities from playful, soft, serious to conservative.

generally they have a modern, serious or neutral feel to them.

![[Pasted image 20231213073544.png | 500]]

### Display/Decorative
They have the strongest personality, but if not used properly it can turn out to be silly looking.

![[Pasted image 20231213074030.png | 250]]
Never used for paragraph texts, only for headings.

### Script
This styles is based on handwriting, it used very rarely. If used it is for headlines only.

![[Pasted image 20231213074306.png|400]]


Most typefaces are created by designers for specific use. Always read the description of the typefaces when using them.

If in the description it is said that it is for general use then it means that it can be used both for headlines and paragraphs, but if it is written used for display, it means it should be used only for headlines. If used in paragraphs it causes poor readability. 

## Setting Type

When we want to customize the spacing between letters we change it's setting type.
#### **Wide Spacing**
Increasing the space between letters can have a nice effect on light weight fonts that can make it feel more important, finished and refined look or have subtle effect when used as a secondary headline.

![[Pasted image 20231213094716.png|500]]

This type of extra white spacing is called panorama. One thing to notice is that this effect works well only with all letters being uppercase. Here are few examples :-

![[Pasted image 20231213094248.png]]

#### **Tight Spacing**

When we are using very heavy weighted fonts Tight spacing is the way to go.

![[Pasted image 20231213095140.png]]

***Note** - Increase spacing when font gets smaller or lighter & decrease spacing when the font gets bigger or bolder.*

### **Line Spacing**

![[Pasted image 20231213095607.png]]

Line spacing in the left is very small due to which it's readability decreases. The right is more pleasant to the eye. when dealing with light weight fonts the line spacing should not be compact.

Sometimes we need to shrink the line spacing when dealing with heavy fonts.

![[Pasted image 20231213100603.png]]

### Font Weights

Every typeface as it's own different font weights. Some have many and some have fewer options.

As designers it is easy to work with typefaces that offer many font weights, its good practice
Example Open Sans has 5 different font weights, Ariel on the other hand has only 2 font weights Regular and Bold which make it limiting for designers to use.

when we need to create a **hierarchy** multiple font weights are needed, like to differentiate between heading and subheading etc.
